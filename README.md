# click ad predictor (Logistic Regression Project)

In this supervised machine learning project, I have used a fake advertisement dataset to train a model. the goal of the model is to predict if a user will click on a 'ad' or not based on the user features. and because it is a binary classification problem, I have used Logistic Regression model to fit the data.
